# WYT React

React-based Mobile Responsive front-end app for the 'What You Think?' Yahoo Fantasy Basketball Trade Tool Opinion Aggregator app.

This Web App aims to make it easier for Yahoo! Fantasy Basketball managers to ask for opinions from friends about trades they're looking to make. By creating a shareable link where guest users can comment, WYT retools the old process of forum shopping. Fantasy Basketball managers no longer need to take individual screenshots then send via a messaging app nor post incomplete information on Reddit threads.

## Important!
*To access the full-functionality of the app, you must have a Yahoo account currently playing in the NBA Fantasy (specifically within a League with an Active Roster). We use real data to create and compare stats of the players. 

Otherwise, you may click on the below Trade Links to see how a guest user will view and use the shareable trade link:*

###  Objectives

 - User should be able to login via Yahoo email
 - When user logs in, they should be redirected to the index page which is the list of all trade proposals they have. They can also delete a trade from this dashboard 
 - On the index page, user should be able to create new trade proposal
 - On the create page, user should see his team name, the players on his team and their stats. 
 - On the create page, user should see a dropdown menu to choose which team he wants to trade with. Upon selection, the players of that team should be listed with their stats
 - When a user clicks a specific trade proposal, they should be able to see the details of the trade: which players will be traded and which players will be received.
 - User should be able to edit the trade to be able to change players involved 
 - On the show trade proposal page, user should see a list of comments from other users.
 - On the show trade proposal page, any user can fill out the comment form with their name and comment on the trade
